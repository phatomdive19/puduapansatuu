                Furnishing a college dorm room can get expensive. If you&#039;re feeling particularly crafty, you can hang old pictures on a clothesline. Although many college students are enjoying their summers, july is a perfect time to start thinking about how you.

    <p>Paint swatches are free at many hardware stores, and they&#039;re good for more than deciding on a paint shade. Going to college is expensive and there is no reason you should spend hundreds on dorm decor when you can just be creative!

After all, home furnishings and decor can be very expensive if you buy everything all at once.</p>
